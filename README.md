# Two different views about the issue: Data Security 
In this document, I discuss two articles about data security problem that is really common in today's society. And I present and discuss two opposing views on this important matter.

## Article 1:
In IBM's [Americans’ Views About Data Collection and Security](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2015/05/20/americans-views-about-data-collection-and-security/), it sheds light on a critical issue plaguing modern society – the erosion of data security in an increasingly digital world. Americans are increasingly apprehensive about the ways in which their data is being collected, stored, and used by both private companies and the government. 

The article highlights that a substantial portion of Americans feel they have limited control over their personal information. This perceived lack of control is likely exacerbated by the complexity of data ecosystems, where data is constantly collected across various digital platforms, often without users' full awareness or consent. Such concerns underscore the necessity for comprehensive data protection legislation and policies that empower individuals with greater control over their data. Moreover, it's crucial for organizations to prioritize transparency and user consent when it comes to data collection practices, ensuring that individuals have the agency to make informed decisions about how their data is utilized. In an era marked by increasing cyber threats and data breaches, building trust and security into data handling processes is not just a consumer demand but an ethical imperative.

After reading this article, it's evident that people are becoming more vigilant about their data security. Many individuals may not have a comprehensive understanding of how their data is collected and used. Therefore, it is essential to provide education and resources to help people better comprehend digital privacy issues and make informed decisions. Digital literacy is not only a personal need but also a societal one. Only when the public possesses adequate digital literacy can they protect their privacy effectively and contribute to creating a safer and more trustworthy digital environment. In this digital age, where the value and risks associated with data are continually increasing, elevating digital literacy levels is of paramount importance.

## Article 2:
In the article [Research shows extensive use of AI contains data breaches faster and saves significant costs](https://www.ibm.com/blog/research-shows-extensive-use-of-ai-contains-data-breaches-faster-and-saves-significant-costs/), it discusses the extensive use of AI in detecting and mitigating data breaches is a compelling testament to the potential of artificial intelligence in enhancing the data security. 

By using the AI-driven breach detection which can save organizations substantial financial resources, it can be spent on lengthy investigations and damage control. This underscores the growing role of AI as a critical tool in the battle against evolving data security and cyber threats. Meanwhile,it highlights how AI's ability to analyze vast amounts of data in real-time enables it to identify unusual patterns and anomalies that may indicate a breach, something that would be virtually impossible for human analysts to achieve at the same speed and scale.  This raises a crucial point – while AI can be a powerful ally in cybersecurity, it is not a standalone solution. Therefore, we, human beings, should still pay more attention on the problem of data security though we can use the AI platform to help us. The synergy between AI and human intelligence is the key to more effective and cost-efficient data breach prevention and response in the digital age.
